# Peer Review Notes

If you find a piece of code design you particularly like, copy it here. Consider phrasing your examples as a "Do this, not that" by including both the design you like, and what that design helped you avoid. 

Put code in code blocks like this to get syntax highlighting, and put a horizontal line between each entry.
